# Countdown Timer

This was a timer quickly written on the way to the Toronto Ippatsu Open
for use in the tournament.
It works well enough to have been used at the tournament, but it can
probably be improved.

## Using the timer

To use the timer:

1. Open the [`timer.html`][timer] file in a browser. Any recent browser should be fine (not IE).
2. Enter in the amount of time to count down from.
3. Press the "Start" button.

The window will flash three times when the countdown finishes.

You can optionally provide a title, which will display above the
countdown.

You may pause the timer at any point by pressing the "Pause" button.
Press the "Resume" button to continue counting down, or press the
"Start" button to restart the countdown.
